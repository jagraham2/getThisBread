# getThisBread
This is a connect 4 game that was developed in the "C" language on a windows operating system
The player or players are first read off some basic instructions when the game has begun
The instructions are as follows:
    the first player to win the majority of games win overall
    at anytime if a letter is entered the program will end
    if the user enters a column choice that doesnt exist or is filled they will be asked to pick another number
    Player 1's symbol is 1 and Player 2 (and AI) symbol is 2
 
 The user is then greeted with "HELLO WELCOME TO CONNECT 4"
 Then asked how many games they would like to play(must be greater than 2)
 Then they are asked to press 1 for single player or 2 for mutiplayer
 
 
 pressing 1 triggers the Ai system which will try to prevent the player from winning while printing out the boards aftr each insert
 
 pressing 2 triggers 2 player in which two players will compete to win
 
 after choosing the game mode the program asks the user for the desired board size (cols first then rows)
 (for best visual effect keep board size below 30 rows by 30 cols)
