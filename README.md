# getThisBread
This is a connect 4 game that was developed in the "C" language on a windows operating system
The player or players are first read off some basic instructions when the game has begun
The instructions are as follows:
    the first player to win 2 games win overall.
    at anytime if a letter is entered the program will end.
    if the user enters a column choice that doesnt exist or is filled they will be asked to pick another number.
    Player 1's symbol is 1 and Player 2 (and AI) symbol is 2.
    
 note: User needs to hit "enter" after every input:
 
 The user is then greeted with "HELLO WELCOME TO CONNECT 4"
 
 
 Then they are asked to press 1 for single player or 2 for mutiplayer
 
 after choosing the game mode the program asks te user to enter number of rows and columns (rows are entered first then columns);
 (for best visual effect keep board size below 30 rows by 30 cols)
 
 
 pressing 1 triggers the Ai system which will try to prevent the player from winning while printing out the boards after each insert
 
 pressing 2 triggers 2 player in which two players will compete to win
